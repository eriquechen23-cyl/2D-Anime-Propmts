Enemies: Giant Beast Horde (Dark silhouettes, fur and muscle, glowing red eyes) located in the deep background.

Act 1 (0.0-2.5s) [The TPS Lock-on]

  - Light: Cold Blue glow from gun illuminating his face against the dusk. Deep Blue Shadows.
- Beat 2 (1.2-2.5s): The Shot (Z-Axis).
  - Action: Recoil. One bullet fires like a compressed blue meteor from the foreground *into* the background.
  - Camera: **Follow Cam**. The camera chases the bullet into the depth (Z-axis).
